# Kubernetes Template Project

KIND has demonstrated to be a very versatile, efficient, cheap and very useful tool for Kubernetes testing.
However, KIND doesn't offer capabilities for testing all the features that depend on cloud-providers, causing a gap on testing.

cloud-provider-kind aim to fill this gap and provide an agnostic and cheap solution for all the Kubernetes features that depend on a cloud-provider using KIND
